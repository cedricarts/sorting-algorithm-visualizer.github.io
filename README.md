#Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a comprehensive, single-file web application that visualizes 15 different sorting algorithms. It is designed as an educational tool to help users understand how each algorithm works by watching it sort an array in real-time.

A Note on Authorship

This project was generated by a large language model (Gemini by Google) in response to a series of prompts. The user's role was to provide the prompts and functional requirements.

Its intended purpose is purely educationalâ€”to serve as a learning tool for visualizing and teaching computer science concepts, not as a portfolio piece for employment.

Features

15 Sorting Algorithms: Includes a wide variety of algorithms, from common to more obscure.

Interactive Controls: Adjust the array size and sorting speed.

Real-time Visualization: Color-coded bars show comparisons, swaps, and sorted elements.

Performance Timer: See how long each algorithm takes to run.

Audio Feedback: Hear the algorithms at work with sounds for comparisons and swaps.

Pseudocode Display: See the pseudocode for the selected algorithm update in real-time.

Single-File Application: The entire project (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is contained in one file.
